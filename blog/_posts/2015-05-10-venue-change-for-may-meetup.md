venues...  Before landing on the perfect location... [Founders Hub](http://foundershub.co.uk/).
Sadly though, the hub has now closed and left a sizeable whole in the Cardiff tech scene.
This leaves us and a number of other events in search of a new home, and after a
lot of looking around and visiting various places we've decided to make that home
the [Acorn Recruitment](http://www.acornpeople.com/our-locations-map/south-wales-midlands/cardiff-branch)
offices just opposite The Castle.

## A New Start

Unified Diff has been running for about three and a half years now, and has
become a pretty established event on the Cardiff tech meetup radar. The original
intention was to build a home that a number of smaller meetups could use to
boost their numbers, and create a more varied and interesting mix of people and
ideas.

We believe that having a good attendance is key to Unified Diff being a success,
the more people we can attract, the more discussion and innovation we can
hopefully help foster. Over recent months numbers have gone down quite a bit,
and this is something we want to see if we can change - to make it the event
that everyone who attends deserves it to be.

## Acorn Offices

Which brings us to the new venue.

We plan to keep the format that we've always had with Unified Diff...  a few
talks from varied tech angles, and then plenty of chat afterwards.  We're also
hoping to add a few little extras, to be generously provided by Acorn
Recruitment like free food and drinks. Finally, we're going to be starting the
event a little bit earlier than we have previously, which will mean less waiting
around after work in the city centre if that's been a problem for you.

So we hope you can make it to see what we have in store for May, we'll be
opening the doors at 6:30, with talks starting around 7pm.  If you haven't had
chance to eat then don't worry we'll have a bunch of pizza available and some
beverages to wash it all down.  Then sit back, enjoy the talks, and meet some
new people.  See you there!
