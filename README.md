# Unified Diff

Source code for the Unified Diff website.

## Hacking

The site is built with Jekyll, and deployed via Github Pages.  You can install
Jekyll by running...

<pre>
gem install jekyll --no-rdoc --no-ri
</pre>

Then after cloning the repo, change to the folder and start the Jekyll server...

<pre>
jekyll serve --watch
</pre>

Jekyll is now running and you should be able to navigate to the following URL to view the website...

<pre>
http://localhost:4000
</pre>

With the --watch flag, any new or modified files will be automatically regenerated by Jekyll.
So when you make changes to files these will automatically be updated, so it's nice and easy to develop.
